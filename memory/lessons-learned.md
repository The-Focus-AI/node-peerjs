# Lessons Learned

## Technical Insights

### WebRTC in Node.js
1. PeerJS requires browser environment mocking
   - Must mock window, navigator, and location objects
   - WebRTC globals need proper setup
   - adapter.js requires special handling

2. Connection Management
   - Connection establishment is asynchronous
   - Event handling is critical for state management
   - Cleanup requires careful handling

3. Testing Challenges
   - Segmentation faults during cleanup
   - Timing issues in connection tests
   - Need for increased timeouts

### Best Solutions

1. Browser Mocking
   ```typescript
   const globalProxy = new Proxy(global, {
     set(target: any, prop: string, value: any) {
       if (prop === 'navigator' || prop === 'window' || prop === 'location') {
         Object.defineProperty(target, prop, {
           value,
           writable: true,
           configurable: true
         });
         return true;
       }
       target[prop] = value;
       return true;
     }
   });
   ```

2. Connection Testing

## WebRTC Environment Setup

1. Browser environment mocking MUST be in the `NodePeer.ts` class file:
   - Required for the class to function
   - Ensures proper setup whenever the class is used
   - Prevents read-only property issues with proxy-based approach
   - Keeps all WebRTC dependencies in one place

2. Known Issues:
   - Segmentation fault during cleanup is a known issue with native WebRTC modules
   - Does not affect core functionality (connection and data transfer work)
   - Occurs after connections are properly closed
   - Related to the native module's memory management during process exit

3. Best Practices:
   - Keep browser mocking code in the main class file
   - Use proxy-based approach for global object modifications
   - Implement proper connection cleanup before destroying peers
   - Log all connection state changes for debugging
   - Add timeouts to prevent hanging operations
