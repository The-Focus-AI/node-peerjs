# WebRTC Node.js Server Project

## Overview
This project implements a WebRTC-based peer-to-peer communication system using PeerJS in a Node.js environment. The goal is to enable direct peer-to-peer connections between nodes for data transfer without requiring a browser environment.

## Key Features
- WebRTC peer-to-peer connections in Node.js
- PeerJS integration for simplified WebRTC handling
- Mock browser environment for PeerJS compatibility
- Data channel communication between peers
- Event-based messaging system

## Core Components
- NodePeer class: Main wrapper for PeerJS functionality
- WebRTC adapter configuration
- Browser environment mocking
- Connection management
- Event handling system

## Project Overview
Create a Node.js/TypeScript implementation that enables a Node.js process to act as a PeerJS peer, capable of establishing peer-to-peer connections with other PeerJS peers (both browser-based and Node.js-based) using the PeerJS library.

## Core Requirements

### PeerJS Integration
- Node.js process should act as a full PeerJS peer
- Support all standard PeerJS functionality
- Maintain compatibility with browser-based PeerJS peers
- Handle peer-to-peer connections through PeerJS infrastructure

### Connection Capabilities
- Connect to other peers (both browser and Node.js based)
- Send and receive data through peer connections
- Handle connection lifecycle events
- Support all PeerJS data types and formats

### Technical Stack
- Node.js runtime
- TypeScript for type safety
- PeerJS for peer-to-peer connectivity
- Any required WebRTC polyfills/implementations for Node.js

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **PeerJS Integration**
   - Initialize PeerJS in Node.js environment
   - Handle any Node.js specific requirements
   - Maintain browser-compatible API

2. **Connection Handler**
   - Manage peer connections
   - Handle connection lifecycle
   - Process data channel communication

3. **Event System**
   - Handle PeerJS events
   - Manage connection states
   - Error handling and recovery

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Research & Setup
1. Verify PeerJS compatibility in Node.js
2. Identify any required polyfills or additional dependencies
3. Set up development environment
4. Create test infrastructure

#### Phase 2: Core Implementation
1. Basic PeerJS peer setup in Node.js
2. Connection handling
3. Data channel implementation
4. Event system setup

#### Phase 3: Feature Completion
1. Full PeerJS API support
2. Error handling
3. Connection recovery
4. Performance optimization

#### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
1. Node.js ↔ Browser peer testing
2. Node.js ↔ Node.js peer testing
3. Connection stress testing
4. Error recovery testing

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- PeerJS initialization
- Connection handling
- Data transmission
- Event handling
- Error recovery

### Integration Tests
- Browser peer connections
- Node.js peer connections
- Data transmission verification
- Connection lifecycle testing

### Test Scenarios
1. Peer discovery and connection
2. Data transmission (all supported types)
3. Connection interruption and recovery
4. Multiple simultaneous connections
5. Error handling and recovery

## Error Handling

### Connection Errors
- Failed connection attempts
- Unexpected disconnections
- Network interruptions
- Invalid peer IDs

### Data Handling Errors
- Invalid data formats
- Transmission failures
- Buffer overflows
- Channel closing

## Performance Considerations

### Connection Management
- Resource allocation per connection
- Memory management
- Event loop impact

### Scalability
- Multiple connection handling
- Resource usage monitoring
- Performance degradation prevention

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
- Node.js (Latest LTS)
- TypeScript
- Testing framework (Vitest)
- Development tools (nodemon, ts-node)

### Build Process
1. TypeScript compilation
2. Test execution
3. Development server with hot reload
