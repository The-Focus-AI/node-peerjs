# Active Context

## Current Status
File transfer implementation is complete and working successfully. The implementation supports both file and stdin data transfer with proper error handling and cleanup.

## Current Features
- File transfer with progress reporting
- Stdin data transfer
- Chunked data transfer (1MB chunks)
- Connection state tracking
- Proper cleanup and error handling
- IPv4 and IPv6 support

## Recent Changes
- Added stdin support
- Improved connection cleanup
- Fixed process termination issues
- Added more detailed logging
- Improved error handling
- Implemented chat application with:
  - Real-time messaging between peers
  - Support for multiple connected peers
  - Username-based message identification
  - System messages for peer events
  - Clean command-line interface
  - Proper connection management and cleanup

## Current Focus
Implementing peer-to-peer example applications to demonstrate NodePeer functionality.

### Status
- File Transfer: Complete and functioning with support for both file and stdin data transfer
- Chat Application: Complete with both Node.js and web clients
- Web Chat Client: Complete with modern UI and real-time messaging

### Recent Changes
1. Implemented web chat client with:
   - Single-page HTML/JS application
   - Modern TailwindCSS interface
   - Real-time PeerJS messaging
   - Connection management

   - System messages and error handling

2. Enhanced chat functionality:
   - Added local message display for better UX
   - Improved connection status indicators
   - Added system messages for events
   - Implemented clean UI with custom styling

3. Previous implementations:
   - Chat application with multi-peer support
   - File transfer with stdin support
   - Connection cleanup and error handling

### Current Features
1. Web Chat Client:
   - Modern, responsive interface
   - Real-time messaging
   - Connection management
   - Username support
   - System messages
   - Local message display
   - Error handling

2. Chat Application:
   - Node.js command-line interface
   - Multi-peer messaging
   - Username support
   - System messages
   - Clean exit handling

3. File Transfer:
   - File and stdin data transfer
   - Progress reporting
   - Connection state tracking
   - Error handling

## Blockers
None currently.

## Next Steps
1. Chat Enhancements:
   - Add file sharing
   - Implement chat rooms
   - Add message persistence
   - Support rich text and emoji
   - Add typing indicators
   - Implement read receipts

2. File Transfer Improvements:
   - Add compression support
   - Implement multiple file transfers
   - Add resume capability
   - Add integrity checks

## Recent Decisions
1. Web Chat Client:
   - Used single-page design for simplicity
   - Implemented local message display
   - Added system messages for better UX
   - Used TailwindCSS for modern design
   - Maintained compatibility with Node.js client

2. Previous Decisions:
   - Used class-based structure for chat
   - Implemented broadcast messaging
   - Enhanced cleanup process
   - Added progress reporting

### Notes
- All examples demonstrate different aspects of peer-to-peer communication
- Focus on maintainable, well-documented code
- Emphasis on proper error handling and cleanup
- Consider security implications for future enhancements

## Implementation Notes

### Testing Approach
- Using plain Node.js test runner
- Simple async/await based tests
- Clear test output and reporting
- Timeout handling for async operations

### Type Safety
- Using JSDoc comments for type information
- Removed all TypeScript dependencies
- Maintaining type documentation in comments
- Clean JavaScript implementation

### Build Process
- Pure JavaScript/Node.js implementation
- Native ESM modules
- No build step required
- Direct execution with Node.js
