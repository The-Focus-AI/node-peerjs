# Project Progress

## Current Status
- Phase 1 (Core Implementation): 100% Complete
- Phase 2 (Testing and Validation): 40% Complete
- Phase 3 (Error Handling and Stability): 0% Complete
- Phase 4 (Documentation and Examples): 0% Complete

## Recent Progress
[2024-03-29]
- Successfully implemented basic peer-to-peer connection
- Completed message exchange functionality
- Working on test stability issues
- Identified cleanup process challenges

## Current Focus
- Stabilizing test execution
- Investigating segmentation fault during cleanup
- Improving error handling during connection termination

## Blockers
1. Test stability issues during cleanup
2. Segmentation fault in node-webrtc bindings
3. Cleanup process needs improvement

## Next Steps
1. Resolve test stability issues
2. Implement more robust cleanup process
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Begin documentation phase

## Overall Progress: 35%
