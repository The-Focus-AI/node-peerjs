- Support for multiple connected peers
- Username-based message identification
- System messages for peer events
- Clean command-line interface
- Proper connection management

### Web Chat Client
- Modern, responsive interface built with TailwindCSS
- Real-time messaging with PeerJS
- Seamless integration with Node.js chat
- Connection status indicators
- Local message display
- System messages and error handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Modern web browser (for web client)
- Internet connection for peer discovery

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd nodepeer-examples
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### File Transfer

1. Start receiver:
   ```bash
   node src-js/examples/file-transfer.js receive <peer-id>
   ```

2. Send a file:
   ```bash
   node src-js/examples/file-transfer.js send <file-path>
   ```

3. Send from stdin:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello World" | node src-js/examples/file-transfer.js send
   ```

### Chat Application

1. Start as standalone:
   ```bash
   node src-js/examples/chat.js
   ```

2. Connect to a peer:
   ```bash
   node src-js/examples/chat.js <peer-id>
   ```

Commands:
- Type messages and press Enter to send
- Type `/quit` to exit
- Use Ctrl+C for clean exit

### Web Chat Client

1. Open `src-js/examples/chat.html` in a web browser
2. Enter your username when prompted
3. To connect to a peer:
   - Copy the peer ID from another chat instance
   - Paste it into the "Enter peer ID to connect" field
   - Click "Connect"
4. Start chatting!
